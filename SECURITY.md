# Reporting Security Issues
The JDDE team and community take security bugs in JDDE seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

The JDDE team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the npm contact form by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## The JDDE Security Notification Process
For context on JDDE's security notification process, please see the Notifications section of the Security WG's Membership and Notifications Governance document.
